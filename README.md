# Quantum-Computer
A Quantum Computer that isn't too complicated project.
# What is Quantum Computer?
Quantum computers are machines that work with qubits (quantum bits) rather than regular bits.
# What's a qubit?
In qubit computers, the classical bit analog is a computer-information unit. There are two situations here, vertical polarization and horizontal polarization. A qubit is a bistable mechanical mechanics system such as the photon polarization of a single photon.
# Setup
